# This smeka file creates the preprocessor
# settings.

# Default pre-processor commands
# (probably we should do a check to ensure
#  it works)
# Sadly there are many variations of CPP
#   -C is needed to disregard C-comments (the operator // is a comment!?!)
#   -nostdinc is needed to not include standard includes (which are C comments)
#   -E only preprocess, do not try and compile
#   -P do not add line markers
# clang-3.5 (MacOSx): -E -EP -xc
# clang-3.7> (MacOSx): -E -P -x c
# cpp(gnu): -E -P -x c -nostdinc
CPP ?= cpp -E -P -x c
