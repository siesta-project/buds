The basic structure here is the following:

- refype_* files
  These files consists of inclusions in data-containers, etc. which
  are common for a variety of data-types.
  Essentially these comprise common components.

- *.F90
  These files are the actual implementation modules.

  They are typically only wrappers for the *.inc files
  which contain the actual implementation.

  They depend on refype_* and *.inc files.

- *.inc files
  These files are the included files that define most of the actual
  implementation.

  They provide the data-types, interfaces and important routines for
  the corresponding data-types.

  If one wishes to extend functionaly these files should be consolidated.
